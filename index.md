## About Me

My research interests span theoretical and applied cryptography and its applications throughout and beyond computing & data sciences. My work often involves one or more of the following:
- Design and develop crypto algorithms with provable, composable security guarantees,
- Deploy privacy-respecting systems for data scientists to work with data they cannot see, or
- Examine the social aspects of cryptography, including its impacts on law and public policy.

I work as an Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). I serve as the director of the [CDS Hub for Civic Tech Impact](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/research-impact/civic-tech/), co-director of [BU's Center for Reliable Information Systems & Cyber Security](https://www.bu.edu/riscs/), member of the [BU Security Group](https://www.bu.edu/cs/research-groups/security/busec/), and member of the [Cyber Security, Law, and Society Alliance](https://www.bu.edu/hic/centers-initiatives-labs/cyber-alliance/). I am also an affiliate of BU's [Computer Science department](https://www.bu.edu/cs/people/faculty/).

I received a [PhD in Mathematics from MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/64489) in 2010, and a [BSE from Duke University](https://math.duke.edu/undergraduate/graduation-with-distinction/senior-theses) in 2005.

### Applying to work with me

If you are a current or prospective student and would like to work with me, here's how to do so.

- If you are a current BU undergraduate or MS student: register for a cryptography course such as [Crypto for Data Science](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cds/courses/cds-ds-453/) or [Fundamentals of Cryptography](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/courses/cas-cs-538/), and consider attending some [BUsec seminars](https://www.bu.edu/cs/research-groups/security/busec/busec-calendar/). These are the best ways to develop your skills and determine your interest level in cryptography. Then, write me an email that clearly explains your research interests, and I will see if I have an ongoing or forthcoming research project where you can contribute.

- If you are not a current BU student: apply to the [BU CDS PhD program](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/programs-admissions/phd-degree/). I will read your application if you clearly state my name as a potential advisor (but I am unlikely to respond to emails about the program). I'm looking for students with a strong grasp of math fundamentals including writing proofs, some exposure to crypto or theoretical computer science, and an enthusiasm to find new ways to apply cryptographic tools in society. Interest in other social, natural, computational, or data sciences is a plus since I enjoy interdisciplinary research.

Boston University has vibrant communities in [cybersecurity](https://www.bu.edu/riscs/people/) and [theoretical computer science](https://www.bu.edu/tcs/), and it is recognized as a [Center of Academic Excellence](https://www.caecommunity.org/cae-map) in Cyber Defense and Research.
Students who I advise have also worked with other faculty members like [Allison McDonald](https://amcdon.com/) and [Kira Goldner](https://www.kiragoldner.com/) in CDS; [Ari Trachtenberg](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/ari-trachtenberg/) in ECE; and [Ran Canetti](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/ran-canetti/), [Sharon Goldberg](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/), [Leo Reyzin](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~reyzin/), [Adam Smith](https://cs-people.bu.edu/ads22/), and [Eran Tromer](https://cs-people.bu.edu/tromer/) in CS. In 2024-25, I'm also excited to host [Dan Roche](https://roche.work/) as a visiting professor at BU.
