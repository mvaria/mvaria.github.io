## About Me

I am an Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).
I research theoretical and applied cryptography, and its applications throughout and beyond computing & data sciences.

I am also the director of the CDS [Hub for Civic Tech Impact](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/research-impact/civic-tech/), co-director of BU's [Center for Reliable Information Systems & Cyber Security](https://www.bu.edu/riscs/), and a founding member of the [Cyber Security, Law, and Society Alliance](https://www.bu.edu/hic/centers-initiatives-labs/cyber-alliance/).

I received a [PhD in Mathematics from MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/64489) in 2010, and a [BSE from Duke University](https://math.duke.edu/undergraduate/graduation-with-distinction/senior-theses) in 2005.
